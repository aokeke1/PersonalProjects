uses a random strategy to play currently

need to add more strategies

Monte Carlo simulation made

need to add different ways of scoring the board to adapt into strategies

I should create a different file for strategies and maybe a different file for scoring methods, but they sort of go hand in hand

I need to find a way to make the strategy selection better so that I don't need to change several spots whenever I make a new strategy

Strategy 7 can get tricked into stalemate by 3 time repetition.
